# Coaching Cat Docs

Here you will find various guides and docs around tech-related things. I'm mostly exploring
LUME and Deno, but figure I may as well build something with this and see how nice it comes
together. So far, very impressed!

## Getting Started

Use the left navigation or top search box to look around.

Not finding what you were hoping to? Let me know at [andy_guice@hotmail.com](mailto:andy_guice@hotmail.com)
or create an issue in the Gitlab repository.
