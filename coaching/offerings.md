# My Offerings

## About Me

I am a veteran in the tech industry who has worn many hats, and can coach on many subjects. With that said, I am most passionate about User Interfaces (UI) and User Experiences (UX). These are things often overlooked in the industry in my experience, and I strive to bring attention to it while teaching others along the way

## What I Coach

- Javascript
- Golang
- Python
- CI/CD and DevOps
- Server administration
- Writing docs as code
- ...and pretty much anything around full-stack development

## Favorite Stacks

- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.studio/)

## Useless Extra Info

I also love this damn cat so much. This is my baby girl, Dee Dee or lovingly named "Dibbles" for no actual reason other than it's cute and she responds to it well.
